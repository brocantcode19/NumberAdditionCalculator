Working on the Number Addition Calculator was a great opportunity to sharpen my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub. 
I learned how to structure a web page properly, style it using CSS flexbox, custom colors, and rounded borders, and add interactivity with JavaScript event listeners.
Additionally, I explored how to manage a project with Git, faced authentication errors when pushing to GitHub, and resolved them by setting up SSH keys.
